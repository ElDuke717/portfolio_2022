# Porfolio

## This is a repo containing my development portfolio, updated in 2022 and continuously maintained. It has been built using React.

### To Do
* Add main landing page that replicates portfolio site built for FEWD, with improvements.
  - Make this as a separate component, then link to the other parts of the portfolio as other components.
* Add and update blog section with posts about my work. Decide whether to use bootstrap or some similar framework.  May consider using Markdown... it would be interesting to see what's out there and worth using.  Is it possible to make a blog out of Markdown hosted on Github?
* Add and update about section with information about me - see static html portfolio site for example.

### Components/Sections to include:

1. Main landing page that just has my name and a link to the other sections.
2. Blog section with posts about my work and other thoughts on learning and development.
3. About section with information about me - possibly this could be a simple resume built with Bootstrap.
4. Portfolio - this may have to be links to different projects hosted on Github.  Most are already there, I just need to host FSJS project  6 (express app) FSJS Project 8 (library app), and FSJS Project 10 (Course app).
